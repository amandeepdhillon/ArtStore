# This "Art Store" is the amalgamation of three assignments which built upon each other throughout the course of a semester. It is written in PHP and JavaScript and is built on a MySQL database. The UI has been designed using Semantic UI. This Art Store enables you to browse through paintings and add them to your favourites or the shopping cart. You can also browse by the Artist, Gallery, Genre, and Subject. The single painting page includes all the details of the painting and enables you to customize the order of the painting, such as selecting from drop-downs the type of frame you want or the type of glass you prefer.
